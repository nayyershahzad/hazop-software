# PDF Upload Issue - FIXED

**Date**: October 13, 2025
**Issue**: "Failed to Upload PDF, check console for details"
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Problem

Users were experiencing PDF upload failures when trying to upload P&ID documents.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the frontend `PIDViewer.tsx` component. When uploading files with FormData, the code was manually setting the `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data`, which prevented the browser from automatically adding the required `boundary` parameter.

### Before (Incorrect):
```typescript
await axios.post(`${API_URL}/api/pid/upload/${selectedNodeId}`, formData, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'  // ❌ This breaks the upload
  }
});
```

## Solution

**Fixed in**: `frontend/src/components/PIDViewer.tsx` (line 187-192)

Removed the manual `Content-Type` header and let axios/browser set it automatically with the proper boundary:

### After (Correct):
```typescript
await axios.post(`${API_URL}/api/pid/upload/${selectedNodeId}`, formData, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
    // ✅ Let axios set Content-Type with boundary automatically
  }
});
```

## Additional Improvements

1. **Better Error Messages**: Now shows the actual error from the server
2. **Success Feedback**: Shows "P&ID uploaded successfully!" alert
3. **Detailed Errors**: Shows specific error message with helpful hint

### Error Handling Enhancement:
```typescript
catch (err: any) {
  console.error('Failed to upload P&ID:', err);
  const errorMsg = err.response?.data?.detail || err.message || 'Unknown error';
  alert(`Failed to upload PDF: ${errorMsg}\n\nCheck console for details.`);
}
```

## Common Upload Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Not authenticated" error
**Cause**: No valid login token
**Solution**: Login again or refresh your token

### Issue 2: "Only PDF files are allowed"
**Cause**: Trying to upload non-PDF file
**Solution**: Ensure file has .pdf extension

### Issue 3: "Node not found"
**Cause**: Invalid node ID or node doesn't exist
**Solution**: Ensure you've selected a valid node before uploading

### Issue 4: "Failed to save file"
**Cause**: Backend can't write to uploads directory
**Solution**:
```bash
cd /Users/nayyershahzad/HAZOP-Software/backend
mkdir -p uploads
chmod 755 uploads
```
