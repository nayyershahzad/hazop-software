# P&ID Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram) integration feature has been **fully implemented** and is ready for use. This feature allows users to upload PDF documents of P&IDs and mark node locations directly on the diagrams for better visualization during HAZOP studies.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Backend Implementation

#### 1. Database Models ([backend/app/models/pid.py](backend/app/models/pid.py))
- **PIDDocument Model**
  - Stores uploaded P&ID PDF files
  - Tracks filename, file path, total pages
  - Links to study and uploader
  - Automatic cascade delete with study

- **NodePIDLocation Model**
  - Stores node location markers on P&IDs
  - Coordinates stored as percentages (0-100) for responsive display
  - Links node to specific page and position
  - Automatic cascade delete with node or P&ID

#### 2. API Endpoints ([backend/app/api/pid.py](backend/app/api/pid.py))
- `POST /api/pid/upload/{study_id}` - Upload P&ID PDF
- `GET /api/pid/study/{study_id}` - List all P&IDs for a study
- `GET /api/pid/file/{pid_id}` - Download/view P&ID file
- `DELETE /api/pid/{pid_id}` - Delete P&ID document
- `POST /api/pid/location` - Create/update node location marker
- `GET /api/pid/location/node/{node_id}` - Get node's location
- `GET /api/pid/location/pid/{pid_id}` - Get all locations for a P&ID
- `DELETE /api/pid/location/{location_id}` - Delete location marker

#### 3. Features
- PDF page count extraction using PyPDF2
- File validation (PDF only)
- Secure file storage with unique filenames
- JWT authentication on all endpoints
- Update existing location if marking same node again

### Frontend Implementation

#### 1. PIDViewer Component ([frontend/src/components/PIDViewer.tsx](frontend/src/components/PIDViewer.tsx))
- **PDF Rendering**
  - React-pdf integration for PDF display
  - Responsive sizing
  - Multi-page support with navigation controls

- **Upload Modal**
  - Drag-and-drop or file picker
  - PDF validation
  - Progress feedback

- **Node Location Marking**
  - Click-to-mark mode toggle
  - Visual crosshair cursor
  - Percentage-based coordinates (responsive)
  - Confirmation after marking

- **Visual Markers**
  - Circular markers on node locations
  - Color coding:
    - Blue markers for all nodes
    - Green pulsing marker for selected node
  - Markers only show on current page
  - Tooltips on hover

- **Auto-Navigation**
  - When a node is selected, automatically navigate to its P&ID page
  - Highlight the selected node's marker
  - Smooth user experience

#### 2. Integration ([frontend/src/pages/StudyDetail.tsx](frontend/src/pages/StudyDetail.tsx))
- P&ID Viewer displayed at top of study detail page
- Full-width layout (600px height)
- Connected to selected node state
- Automatic refresh after marking locations

## üéØ User Workflow

### 1. Upload P&ID
1. Open a HAZOP study
2. Click "Upload P&ID" button
3. Select PDF file
4. Upload completes and P&ID displays

### 2. Mark Node Locations
1. Create or select a node from the list
2. Click "Mark Node Location" button (marking mode activates)
3. Click on the P&ID where the node is located
4. Location is saved and marker appears

### 3. Navigate P&IDs
1. Use page navigation (Previous/Next buttons)
2. Page counter shows current position
3. Select different P&IDs from dropdown (if multiple uploaded)

### 4. Auto-Navigate to Node
1. Click on any node in the nodes list
2. P&ID automatically navigates to that node's page
3. Node's marker pulses in green for easy identification

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User uploads PDF
    ‚Üì
Backend saves file & creates PIDDocument record
    ‚Üì
Frontend displays PDF using react-pdf
    ‚Üì
User clicks on PDF in marking mode
    ‚Üì
Coordinates calculated as percentages
    ‚Üì
Backend creates NodePIDLocation record
    ‚Üì
Frontend fetches and displays markers
```

### Coordinate System
- **Percentage-based** (0-100 for both X and Y)
- Advantages:
  - Responsive to different screen sizes
  - Independent of PDF resolution
  - Consistent across zoom levels

### File Storage
- Directory structure: `./uploads/{study_id}/{timestamp}_{filename}.pdf`
- Unique filenames prevent collisions
- Automatic cleanup on study deletion

---

## üîê Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**
   - All endpoints require valid JWT token
   - User must be logged in

2. **File Validation**
   - Only PDF files allowed
   - File type checking
   - Size limits (50MB max)

3. **Access Control**
   - Users can only access P&IDs for studies they have access to
   - File paths not exposed to client

---

## üì¶ Dependencies

### Backend
- `PyPDF2==3.0.1` - PDF page counting
- `python-multipart==0.0.6` - File upload handling

### Frontend
- `react-pdf==^10.1.0` - PDF rendering
- `pdfjs-dist==^5.4.296` - PDF.js library

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **PDF Size**
   - Large PDFs (>50MB) are rejected
   - Very complex PDFs may load slowly

2. **Browser Support**
   - PDF.js worker loaded from CDN
   - Requires modern browser with Canvas support

3. **Mobile Support**
   - Works on mobile but marking may be less precise
   - Recommended to use on desktop/tablet

   - [ ] Zoom in/out on P&IDs
   - [ ] Pan/drag to navigate large P&IDs
   - [ ] Multiple markers per node (for complex nodes)
   - [ ] Node labels on markers

2. **Collaboration**
   - [ ] Real-time marker updates
   - [ ] Show who marked which node

3. **Export**
   - [ ] Export P&ID with all markers
   - [ ] Include P&ID in HAZOP reports

4. **Performance**
   - [ ] Lazy loading for multi-page P&IDs
   - [ ] Thumbnail preview of pages
   - [ ] Cached rendering

## üéì User Documentation

### For HAZOP Facilitators

**Q: Why use P&ID integration?**
A: Visual reference helps team members quickly identify equipment, connections, and process flow during analysis.

**Q: Can I upload multiple P&IDs?**
A: Yes! Upload as many as needed and switch between them using the dropdown.

**Q: What if I mark the wrong location?**
A: Just click "Mark Node Location" again and click the correct spot. The old marker will be replaced.

**Q: Do I need to mark every node?**
A: No, it's optional. Marking is helpful for complex systems but not required.
