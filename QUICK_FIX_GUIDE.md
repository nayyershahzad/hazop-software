## 🔍 How to Tell It's Working

### ✅ Correct (With Parent Links)
```sql
-- Database check:
SELECT consequence_description, cause_id FROM consequences;

Result:
Production loss          | 12345678-abcd-... ✅ Has cause_id
Equipment damage         | 12345678-abcd-... ✅ Has cause_id
```

### ❌ Incorrect (Without Parent Links)
```sql
SELECT consequence_description, cause_id FROM consequences;

Result:
Production loss          | NULL              ❌ No cause_id
Equipment damage         | NULL              ❌ No cause_id
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "Add All" button is grayed out
- **Solution**: Select a parent item first (Cause or Consequence)

**Problem**: Alert says "Select a Cause first"
- **Solution**: Click on a Cause in the list to highlight it

**Problem**: Alert says "Select a Consequence first"
- **Solution**: Expand a Cause (▶ → ▼), then click on a Consequence

**Problem**: Items are added but don't appear in the list
- **Solution**: Refresh the page - they should appear correctly now with the fix
